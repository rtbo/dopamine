# Dopamine package manager

Package manager for compiled languages.

## Goals

- Easier C / C++ / D / Rust / Fortran interoperability
- Build-system agnosticity
- Possibility to use Dub packages as dependency
- Allows to look-up for installed dependency before downloading and build
- Lock dependency versions for a deterministic libraries/application dependencies
- Reduce compilation time by providing ready to use binary dependency packages
- Make cross-compilation just as easy as compilation for the local system
